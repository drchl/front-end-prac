    <h1>Opalite</h1>
    <h2><mark><small>by: Taylor Swift</small></mark></h2>

    <pre>
    I had a <b>bad habit</b>
    Of <ins>missing lovers past</ins>
    My brother used to call it
    <i>'Eating out of the trash'</i>
    It's never gonna last

    I thought my <b>house was haunted</b>
    I used to live with ghosts
    And all the perfect couples
    Said, "When you know you know."
    And, "When you don't you don't."

    And all of the <b>foes and all of the friends</b>
    Have seen it before, <i>they'll see it again</i>
    Life is a song, it ends when it ends
    I was wrong

    But my Mama told me
    <b>It's alright</b>
    You were dancing through the lightning strikes
    Sleepless in the <i>onyx night</i>
    But now the sky is opalite
    Oh oh oh oh, oh my Lord
    Never made no one like you before
    You had to make your own sunshine
    <ins>But now the sky is opalite</ins>
    Oh oh oh oh oh

    You couldn't understand it
    <b>Why you felt alone</b>
    You were in it for real
    She was in her phone
    And you were just a pose

    And don't we try to love love
    We give it all we got <i>(we give it all we got)</i>
    You <strong>finally left the table</strong>
    And what a simple thought
    You're starving til you're not
    And all of the foes and all of the friends
    Have messed up before, they'll mess up again
    <em>Life is a song, it ends when it ends</em>
    You move on

    And that's when I told you
    <strong>It's alright</strong>
    You were dancing through the lightning strikes
    Sleepless in the onyx night
    But now the sky is opalite
    Oh oh oh oh, oh my Lord
    Never met no one like you before
    You had to make your own sunshine
    But now the sky is opalite
    Oh oh oh oh oh

    This is just
    A <strong>storm inside a teacup</strong>
    But <i>shelter here with me, my love</i>
    Thunder like a drum
    This life will beat you up, up, up, up
    This is just a temporary speed bump
    But <strong>failure brings you freedom</strong>
    And I can bring you love, love, love, love, love
    Don't you sweat it, baby

    It's alright
    You were <b>dancing through the lightning strikes</b>
    Sleepless in the onyx night
    But now the sky is opalite
    <i>Oh oh oh oh</i>, oh my Lord
    Never made no one like you before, no
    You had to <ins>make your own sunshine</ins>
    But now the <strong>sky is opalite</strong>
    Oh oh oh oh oh
    </pre>
